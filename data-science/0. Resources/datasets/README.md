# Datasets

Choose *one* dataset as your chosen regression dataset from the list below.

You may not use other datasets, as these datasets have been chosen by the MSA team for the following reasons:
- They are clean enough for anyone to get started with while not being completely unusable due to data quality issues
- They are small enough for anyone to analyse and run models with on their own devices
- Keeping the list of datasets small allows us to mark students fairly and compare student's work across submissions to ensure that students are getting the credit they deserve, or implement scaling procedures if needed
- Keeping the list of datasets small allows you to work within creative constraints and focus on your analysis and modelling skills, as opposed to dealing with issues pertaining to specific datasets or work with datasets you may have already used in the past

## Regression

Sales forecasting is a critical component of a company's strategic planning. It aids in resource allocation, financial planning, inventory management, strategic growth, performance monitoring, risk management, and pricing strategies. The selected dataset includes sales data and correlated information from various companies. Your task is to select one dataset and develop a sales prediction for it. Do the sales prediction in weekly manner (week-wise intervals) to at least 4 weeks (12 weeks good to have).
