Welcome to trade up wizard!
This website allows you to login/signup. Create your own contracts and even share them with others!

The frontend uses vite and is hosted on a web server on azure found here: https://victorious-river-0616bfb1e.5.azurestaticapps.net//

The backend is built with dotnet with CRUD functionality allowing all functionality of the website to persist for all users. The swaggerui for the backend can be found here: https://contractwizardapi-asa8emcbh7aqayer.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html

Both of these are kept up to date with github actions to make sure that the user experience is as smooth as possible!

Note: This repository was initially a fork of the 2024 phase 2 repo. Hence the high number of contributers and commit count. Rest assured the only contributer was the submitter (Caidora)
